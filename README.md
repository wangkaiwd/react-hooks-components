## React practice

Write some components to study usage of react.

Plan to implement following components:

* Input
* AutoComplete
* Menu
* Form
* Tree
* Table
* UpPullRefresh/DownPullMore
* VirtualList

And plan to implement following simple but useful custom hooks:

* useUpdate
* useUpdateEffect
* useGetSet
* useGetSetState

### Experience

* useEffect always trigger after component first render, event pass dependencies array to it

### Reference resource
